🚀 What is Password Analyzer?
Password Analyzer is your personal cybersecurity assistant — a high-impact, locally-run tool that inspects passwords with military-grade scrutiny and empowers you to generate passwords that are virtually uncrackable.

It evaluates, exposes weaknesses, calculates entropy, checks against real-world breaches (via HaveIBeenPwned), and gives you actionable advice. Plus, it generates ironclad passwords you can actually use.

💣 “Your password is the weakest link. Make it bulletproof.”
